## About my Project

This started as I was bored of the CodeHS work and just decided to push my knowladge of Java myself and work on something of my own. So I decided to make a simple Text Dungeon Crawler RPG.

## What is Visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight IDE, it allows for plugins for functionality and customizability. It's really useful for smaller projects.

---
## What is Chrome Remote Desktop?

Chrome Remote Desktop is a something that I really enjoy as Im able to connect to my Home Computer from a Web Browser and its easy to setup.

---
## Why Chrome Remote Desktop?

I use it for this project as I don't have to deal with version control between multiple PC's as well as The School's PCs arent able to install the requirements to run Java from VSCode.

## Why Not Replit?

For a project like this, Replit isn't the best tool to use due to its limitations and it being fairly slow. Plus managing everything on my own is what im use to and minimizes the limitations I have for the project.
